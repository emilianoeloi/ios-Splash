iOS Splash

## Descriptions


I've created a SplashScreen that transform itself in Navigation Header. I've achieved that by using the LaunchScreen with the same configuration of the MainView. Then i disabled MainView's Bottom constraint and enabled it's Height constraint to animate from fullscreen to header's format.
